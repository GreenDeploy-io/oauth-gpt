## Why This?

I created this GitHub repository to meet the growing need for a clear guide on setting up OAuth
protected endpoints with OpenAI's GPT Builder for custom GPT models.


The goal of this repository is to provide developers and AI enthusiasts with easy-to-understand
resources, focusing on the latest developments in AI and machine learning, especially considering
the new GPT store announced by OpenAI.[^1]


## Roadmap

I divide my roadmap into [committed plans](#committed-plans) and
[uncommitted plans](#not-committed-plans).

Both committed and un-committed plans do not come with a committed timeline.

They will be done when they are done. And in no particular order.

If you want to get updated, you can create a GitHub issue and tell me your preferred method of
getting updates. I am leaning towards a Substack for such purposes. Majority wins.

### Committed Plans

- [x] A copy-and-paste, hello-world, canonical example[^2] using micro Django and DigitalOcean App
Platform to set up OAuth-protected endpoints for custom GPT.

- [ ] A Loom video tutorial on how to use micro Django and DigitalOcean App Platform to set up
OAuth-protected endpoints for custom GPT. (~65% done)

- [ ] A more polished and edited YouTube video tutorial on using micro Django and DigitalOcean App
Platform.

- [ ] A technology-agnostic guide outlining abstract principles, enabling developers to use other
technologies (like Laravel, TypeScript, etc.) and infrastructure providers (AWS, Heroku, etc.).

- [ ] A subscription option (likely a Substack) for updates on any OpenAI changes impacting the
implementation of OAuth-protected endpoints.

### Not Committed Plans

- A directory listing community projects that implement the canonical example using different
technologies and infrastructures.
